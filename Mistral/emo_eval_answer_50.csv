     I understand that you're feeling quite conflicted about your identity, and it's important to acknowledge those feelings. It's not uncommon for people to feel a disconnect between their gender identity and the body they were born with. This feeling you have, of being a girl stuck in a guy's body, is often referred to as gender dysphoria.

     It's essential to remember that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to explore your gender identity further. I would recommend speaking with a mental health professional who specializes in gender issues, as they can provide you with guidance and support during this process.

     In the meantime, I encourage you to take some time to reflect on how you feel about your gender identity. You might find it helpful to research more about gender identity and explore resources online or in books. It's also important to surround yourself with supportive people who can help you navigate this journey.

     Ultimately, the most important thing is that you feel comfortable and authentic in your own skin. I'm here to support you as you continue to explore your identity and find what feels right for you."
"I started dating a guy I met online. He told me that he registered sex offender but he didn't do anything. He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years. That was more than two decades ago. Nothing on his record since.
I always believe the past should be left in past. But my roommates, their family and my son are unforgiving. Should I forgive this man that I'm falling in love with or should I dump him? If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again.","Respond as a therapist. Your answer should follow these steps:

    1. I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, and it's understandable that you're struggling with the bullying and negative self-perception. It's important to remember that your worth is not determined by what others say or think about you, but by your own self-worth and self-love.

2. To help change your perspective, it might be beneficial to focus on making positive changes for yourself, rather than trying to meet others' expectations. This could include setting achievable health and fitness goals, working on self-care, and finding activities that bring you joy and confidence.

3. Regarding the bullying, it's crucial to remember that it's not a reflection of who you are as a person. It's a reflection of the bully's insecurities and lack of empathy. It's important to try and distance yourself from their words and actions, and to seek support from trusted adults or friends.

"A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning.

    ### response:
     I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm glad you've reached out. It's important to remember that it's okay to ask for help. Feeling persistently down or out after giving birth can be a sign of postpartum depression, but it's also important to rule out other possible causes.

     Postpartum depression is a type of depression that some women experience after giving birth. Symptoms can include persistent sadness, anxiety, feelings of worthlessness, difficulty bonding with the baby, and changes in appetite or sleep patterns. However, it's also common for new mothers to experience a range of emotions, including happiness, sadness, and exhaustion, due to the physical and emotional changes that occur during and after pregnancy.

     If you're experiencing symptoms that are interfering with your ability to care for yourself or your baby, it's important to seek help from a healthcare professional. They can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend treatment options, which may include therapy, medication, or both.

     In the meantime, try to take care of yourself as best as you can. This might include getting enough rest, eating a healthy diet, and reaching out to friends and family for support. It's also important to prioritize self-care activities that bring you joy, even if it's just for a few minutes each day.

     Remember, it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to go through this alone. If you're feeling suicidal or have thoughts of harming yourself or your baby, please seek immediate help by calling a crisis hotline in your country.

    ### response:
     Dear heart broken,

I understand how deeply you're feeling right now. It's clear that you love your wife and family deeply, and it's heartbreaking to see a situation that threatens to tear it apart.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to reach out for help. This is a crucial step towards resolving the issue.

It's important to remember that mistakes from the past don't have to define the future. However, it's also essential to address them honestly and openly. This might involve seeking professional help, such as couples therapy, to facilitate open and productive conversations.

In these conversations, it's crucial to listen actively to your wife's feelings and concerns. Acknowledge her pain and validate her emotions. At the same time, express your love for her and your desire to work through this together.

Remember, change takes time and effort. It's not about finding a quick fix, but about committing to a process of growth and healing. This process might involve making sacrifices, apologizing, and making amends.

Lastly, involve your children in the process. They are deeply affected by this situation and their voices matter. Encourage them to express their feelings and concerns, and reassure them that you're working towards a solution that"

Try to paraphrase what the other person is saying to show that you've understood their point of view.

3. It's also crucial to express your feelings and thoughts clearly and calmly. Avoid using accusatory language, and instead, focus on how you feel about the situation. For example, instead of saying ""You never listen to me,"" say ""I feel unheard when I express my feelings, and it makes me feel frustrated.""

If you find yourselves at an impasse, consider seeking the help of a neutral third party, such as a therapist or counselor, to help facilitate a productive conversation."
"My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. We've had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. She's on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacy/romance centered around my hectic schedule. Our sex life has suffered as a result.
Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. Once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm I've ever encountered. I was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. I don't know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further.

    ### response:
    I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this difficult time. It's completely understandable that you're feeling worried and confused about your partner losing feelings for you. It's important to remember that communication is key in any relationship, and it seems like you've been making an effort to give him space and check in on him.

    One approach could be to schedule regular, structured conversations with your partner where you both have a chance to express your feelings and concerns. This can help to ensure that both of you feel heard and understood. It's also important to create a safe and non-judgmental space for these conversations to take place.

    Another suggestion is to focus on spending quality time together, whether it's through shared activities or simply spending time talking and getting to know each other better. This can help to strengthen your connection and rekindle the feelings that have been fading.

    It's also worth considering seeking the help of a relationship counselor or therapist who can provide guidance and support as you work through this challenging time together.

     I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're dealing with a difficult situation in your relationship. It's important to remember that communication is key in any relationship, and it's not healthy for one person to shut down completely like this.

     Here are a few suggestions:

     1. Try to understand that his behavior might be a result of his own emotional turmoil. It's not an excuse, but it might help to approach the situation with empathy.

     2. Instead of asking directly what's wrong, try to create a safe and non-confrontational environment to discuss the issue. For example, you could say something like, ""I've noticed that we've had some disagreements lately, and I'd like to talk about them when you're ready.""

     3. If he responds with sarcasm or hurtful words, it's important to set boundaries. Let him know that such behavior is not acceptable and that you deserve respect.

     4. If he still refuses to communicate or apologize, it might be helpful to seek couples therapy. A therapist can help you both understand each other's perspectives and work on improving your communication skills.

     Remember, it's okay to take a step back from the relationship if it's causing you too much stress or pain. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued and respected."

    When my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days. When I ask what is wrong, I get nothing: no reply, no phone call. If he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful. He never admits he is wrong and never apologizes.
    
    ### response:
     I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're dealing with a difficult situation in your relationship. It's important to remember that communication is key in any relationship, and it's not healthy for one person to shut down completely like this.

     Here are a few suggestions:

     1. Try to understand that his behavior might be a result of his own emotional turmoil. It's not an excuse, but it might help to approach the situation with empathy.

     2. Instead of asking directly what's wrong, try to create a safe and non-confrontational environment to discuss the issue. For example, you could say something like, ""I've noticed that we've had some disagreements lately, and I'd like to talk about them when you're ready.""

     3. If he responds with sarcasm or hurtful words, it's important to set boundaries. Let him know that such behavior is not acceptable and that you deserve respect.

     4. If he still refuses to communicate or apologize, it might be helpful to seek couples therapy. A therapist can help you both understand each other's perspectives and work on improving your communication skills.

     Remember, it's okay to take a step back from the relationship if it's causing you too much stress or pain. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued and respected."

     I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing such distress during intimate moments. It's important to remember that these feelings are a result of past experiences and not a reflection of your current relationship.

     1. **Preparation**: Discuss with your partner about what triggers these flashbacks for you. This way, they can be more understanding and supportive during those moments.

     2. **Relaxation Techniques**: Practicing deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness can help you calm down when a flashback occurs.

     3. **Therapy**: Consider seeking therapy to work through these past experiences and develop coping mechanisms to manage the flashbacks more effectively.

     4. **Self-care**: Make sure to prioritize self-care activities that help you feel grounded and safe, such as exercise, reading, or spending time in nature.

     I'm really sorry to hear that you've been feeling this way for a while now. It's important to remember that you're not alone in this, and seeking help is a brave step.

     Counseling can indeed be very beneficial for managing depression and anxiety. It provides a safe space to explore your feelings, understand the root causes of your distress, and develop coping strategies. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a common approach used in counseling for these issues, as it helps you identify and challenge negative thought patterns that may be contributing to your feelings.

     I would recommend discussing this with your doctor, as they can help you find a counselor who specializes in treating depression and anxiety. If you're unsure about where to start, I can help you find resources in your area.

     In the meantime, it might be helpful to practice self-care activities like exercise, meditation, or journaling to help manage your symptoms. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and it's okay to not feel okay all the time.

    ### response:
     I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way about your relationship with your mother. It's important to have open and supportive communication with our loved ones, especially when it comes to our mental health.

     One approach could be to set boundaries around conversations that are important to you. For example, you might say something like, ""Mom, I really value our relationship and I want to be able to share my feelings with you. However, I've noticed that sometimes when I try to talk to you about personal things, it can be difficult. Can we agree to listen to each other without interrupting or changing the subject, and to take each other's feelings seriously?""

     If your mother is open to this, it can help create a more supportive and understanding environment for both of you. If she is not, it may be helpful to seek out other sources of support, such as a therapist or trusted friend, who can provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to share your feelings.

     It's also important to remember that it's okay to take care of yourself and prioritize your own needs, even if that means setting boundaries with your mother. You deserve to have a supportive and nurturing relationship with the important people in your life, and it's okay to work towards that.

    When my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days. When I ask what is wrong, I get nothing: no reply, no phone call. If he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful. He never admits he is wrong and never apologizes.
    
    ### response:
     I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're dealing with a difficult situation in your relationship. It's important to remember that communication is key in any relationship, and it's not healthy for one person to shut down completely like this.

     Here are a few suggestions:

     1. Try to understand that his behavior might be a result of his own emotional turmoil. It's not an excuse, but it might help to approach the situation with empathy.

     2. Instead of asking directly what's wrong, try to create a safe and non-confrontational environment to discuss the issue. For example, you could say something like, ""I've noticed that we've had some disagreements lately, and I'd like to talk about them when you're ready.""

     3. If he responds with sarcasm or hurtful words, it's important to set boundaries. Let him know that such behavior is not acceptable and that you deserve respect.

     4. If he still refuses to communicate or apologize, it might be helpful to seek couples therapy. A therapist can help you both understand each other's perspectives and work on improving your communication skills.

     Remember, it's okay to take a step back from the relationship if it's causing you too much stress or pain. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued and respected."

     I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing such distress during intimate moments. It's important to remember that these feelings are a result of past experiences and not a reflection of your current relationship.

     To help manage these flashbacks, we could work on a few strategies:

     1. **Preparation**: Discuss with your partner about what triggers these flashbacks for you. This way, they can be more understanding and supportive during those moments.

     2. **Relaxation Techniques**: Practicing deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness can help you calm down when a flashback occurs.

     3. **Therapy**: Consider seeking therapy to work through these past experiences and develop coping mechanisms to manage the flashbacks more effectively.

     4. **Self-care**: Make sure to prioritize self-care activities that help you feel grounded and safe, such as exercise, reading, or spending time in nature.

     Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace, and it's important to be patient with yourself as you work through these challenges. I'm here to support you every step of the way."

    ### response:
     I'm really sorry to hear that you've been feeling this way for a while now. It's important to remember that you're not alone in this, and seeking help is a brave step.

     Counseling can indeed be very beneficial for managing depression and anxiety. It provides a safe space to explore your feelings, understand the root causes of your distress, and develop coping strategies. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a common approach used in counseling for these issues, as it helps you identify and challenge negative thought patterns that may be contributing to your feelings.

     I would recommend discussing this with your doctor, as they can help you find a counselor who specializes in treating depression and anxiety. If you're unsure about where to start, I can help you find resources in your area.

     In the meantime, it might be helpful to practice self-care activities like exercise, meditation, or journaling to help manage your symptoms. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and it's okay to not feel okay all the time.

     Take care and I'm here if you need to talk more."

     I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing nightmares and flashbacks, and I can understand how they might be affecting your current relationship. It's important to remember that these symptoms are common after ending a significant relationship, especially one that was difficult or traumatic.

     Here are a few strategies that might help:

     1. Seek professional help: A therapist who specializes in trauma can provide you with evidence-based treatments like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) to help manage your symptoms.

     2. Practice self-care: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.

     3. Process your feelings: Write in a journal, talk to a trusted friend, or engage in creative activities to help you process your emotions.

     4. Grounding techniques: When you have a flashback or nightmare, try grounding techniques like focusing on your breath, repeating a mantra, or using your five senses to connect with the present moment.

     5. Communicate with your partner: It's important to be open and honest with your partner about what you're experiencing and how they can support you. This can help strengthen your relationship and create a safe space for you to heal.

     I'm here to support you, and I encourage you to reach out if you need someone to talk to."
